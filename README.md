Scratchpad support for [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri): a scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor.

## Install

Add this flake to your inputs.

```nix
inputs = {
  niri-scratchpad-flake = {
    url = "github:gvolpe/niri-scratchpad";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
}
```

Install the package via `niri-scratchpad` or `default`, e.g.

```nix
let
  inherit (inputs.ns-flake.packages.${system}) niri-scratchpad;
in
{
  home.packages = [ niri-scratchpad ];
}
```

Only available for Linux systems, see `nix flake show` for more.

If Nix is not your jam, simply copy the [ns.py](./src/ns.py) script into your system and give it execution permissions (`chmod +x ns.py`). You'll need Python 3 installed.

## Usage

See `nscratch --help` for the available commands.

```console
$ nscratch --help
usage: nscratch [-h] (-id APP_ID | -t TITLE) [-s SPAWN] [-a] [-m]

Niri Scratchpad support

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -id, --app-id APP_ID  The application identifier
  -t, --title TITLE     The application title
  -s, --spawn SPAWN     The process name to spawn when non-existing
  -a, --animations      Enable animations
  -m, --multi-monitor   Multi-monitor support (coming soon)
```

Scratchpad windows can be searched either by `app-id` or `title`.

## Niri Configuration

The workspace "scratch" must exist, the rest is optional.

```kdl
workspace "scratch"

window-rule {
    match app-id=r#"^spotify|nemo$"#
    open-on-workspace "scratch"
    open-floating true
}

spawn-at-startup "spotify"
spawn-at-startup "nemo"
```

For a better experience, *declare all your workspaces explicitly* and add the "scratch" one last. [Example](https://github.com/gvolpe/nix-config/blob/7cc8c60c41a73f30c5c11957a1780496dec265d4/home/wm/niri/config.kdl#L611).

In this example, we create a window rule so that both `spotify` and `nemo` are spawned in the "scratch" workspace. Additionally, we spawn these processes at startup. 

Next, we have our scratchpad keybindings.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Ctrl+S { spawn-sh "nscratch -id spotify"; }
    Mod+Ctrl+F { spawn-sh "nscratch -id nemo"; }
}
```

Both `spotify` and `nemo` are spawned at startup by Niri (via `spawn-at-startup`).

To further enhance your experience, consider setting the size of your scratchpad windows, e.g.

```kdl
window-rule {
    match app-id="nemo"
    open-on-workspace "scratch"
    open-floating true
    default-column-width { fixed 1157; }
    default-window-height { fixed 736; }
}
```

### Spawn

In the following example, we have a keybinding for the Audacious application, which is not spawned by Niri. So we can indicate that if the process does not yet exist, it should be spawned by `nscratch` (internally done via `niri msg spawn`).

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Ctrl+A { spawn-sh "nscratch -id Audacious -s audacious"; }
}
```

**NOTE**: a spawned window via the `--spawn` (or `-s`) flag can't be made floating the first time it's brought up, but it will be from the second time onwards, due to a known limitation. If you would like to avoid this, you can either fix it via a window rule, or by letting Niri start the process at startup instead.

### Animations

Scratchpad animations are disabled by default. To enable them, set the `--animations` or `-a` flag, e.g.

```console
$ nscratch -id nemo -a
```

The animation is achieved by switching the scratchpad window to tiling mode when it's moved to the scratch workspace, and subsequently making it a floating window when it's summoned.

### Multiple monitors

Multi-monitor support is coming soon and it can be enabled via the `multi-monitor` or `-m` flags. It is disabled by default because it requires e few extra IPC commands.

## Known Limitations

Given the fact that Niri doesn't support "hidden" workspaces, this solution imposes a few caveats. First of all, the "scratch" workspace will always be visible if you scroll all the way down to your last workspace; it can't be hidden.

### Dynamic workspaces

If you rely on accessing your workspaces by index (e.g. `Mod+2`, `Mod+3`) and don't explicitly declare your workspaces in your configuration, then it means you're relying on dynamic workspaces, which is the default in Niri.

Declaring only the "scratch" workspace and leaving everything else as dynamic *still works*, but you can't expect your indices to remain the same. So always declare all your workspaces explicitly (see [Named Workspaces](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Named-Workspaces.html)) if you'd like the indices to be predictable.

Nevertheless, a better approach is to access your workspaces by name instead, e.g.

```kdl
workspace "web"
workspace "dev"
workspace "scratch"

binds {
    Mod+1 { focus-workspace "web"; }
    Mod+2 { focus-workspace "dev"; }
    Mod+Shift+1 { move-window-to-workspace "web"; }
    Mod+Shift+2 { move-window-to-workspace "dev"; }
}
```

By using named workspaces, we also get to enjoy dynamic workspaces. See [addressing workspaces by index](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html#addressing-workspaces-by-index) in the official docs for more.
